# `.dotfiles`

Collection of my configuration files

## Get Started

1. Install `git` if you system doesn't already have it.
2. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/andreazllin/.dotfiles.git` in the `~` (read `$HOME`) folder.
   - Note that we're using **HTTPS** so generating an SSH Keypair is not required, but in the future I suggest to work with git using SSH.
3. Run `sh ~/.dotfiles/scripts/init.sh`

## Note

Work in progress
